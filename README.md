# Chirper Project

This repo is a code-along React and Redux project as part of [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

## Overview
This project is a small application inspired by Tweeter. Users can view tweets, like them and reply to them. The application uses Redux to manage the state and actions on this state. The first version of the application was using an older syntax of React, like using classes to define components or using the connect and mapStateToProps functions as part of Redux. The code is now upgraded to use hooks to access local state and the store. It also uses hooks to access routes parameters.

1. clone the repository to your local machine using: git clone https://github.com/jfvanreu/chirper-app.git
